Solar-System-Simulator
======================

The purpose of this project is to realistically model a solar system based on user input.
Currently the output is in 2D, but we will be modifying it to produce a visual output in 3D.
We are still making improvements to this project and plan on continuing to work on it for some time.

Primary developers:
Dexter Parks
Charles Womble
